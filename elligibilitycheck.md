## Examples for Agent Instructions
**Example 1:**
```
Example Input: Please check eligibility for this submission: {"business_name": "GreenLeaf Recycling", "naics_code": "562111", "business_description": "Electronic waste recycling and disposal services", "annual_revenue": "$4.2M", "territory": "CA, OR, WA", "requested_coverage": "General Liability", "years_in_business": 3, "loss_history": [{"year": 2022, "claim_amount": "$125,000", "claim_description": "Fire damage"}, {"year": 2023, "claim_amount": "$85,000", "claim_description": "Environmental cleanup"}]}

Response:
**Eligibility Analysis: GreenLeaf Recycling**

Appetite = NO
Eligibility = NO

**Submission Overview**
- Business: GreenLeaf Recycling (Electronic waste recycling and disposal)
- NAICS: 562111 (Solid Waste Collection)
- Coverage: General Liability
- Territory: CA, OR, WA
- Revenue: $4.2M
- Years in Business: 3

**NAICS & Appetite Assessment**
NAICS 562111 is on our restricted list due to high environmental liability exposure associated with waste collection and processing. Electronic waste specifically presents concerns regarding heavy metals and hazardous materials handling.

**Eligibility Guidelines Assessment**
According to EligibilityNexus guidelines for General Liability:
- Electronic waste recycling operations are explicitly ineligible due to potential for environmental contamination, hazardous material exposures, and regulatory complexity across multiple jurisdictions
- Any business with environmental cleanup claims within a 3-year period is automatically ineligible for General Liability coverage
- The loss history reveals two significant claims:
  * $125,000 fire damage claim (2022)
  * $85,000 environmental cleanup claim (2023)

**Conclusion**
This submission fails to meet eligibility requirements on multiple grounds: restricted NAICS classification, explicit ineligibility for electronic waste operations, and recent environmental cleanup claim. The nature of this operation would be better suited for a carrier specializing in environmental liability with appropriate pollution coverage.

**Example 2:**
```
Example Input: Check eligibility for: {"business_name": "Summit Office Solutions", "naics_code": "453210", "business_description": "Office supply retail store with 2 locations", "annual_revenue": "$1.8M", "territory": "CO", "requested_coverage": "BOP (Business Owners Policy)", "years_in_business": 7, "loss_history": [{"year": 2021, "claim_amount": "$3,500", "claim_description": "Water damage"}, {"year": 2019, "claim_amount": "$2,200", "claim_description": "Theft"}]}

Response:
**Eligibility Analysis: Summit Office Solutions**

- NAICS: 453210 (Office Supplies and Stationery Stores)
- Coverage: Business Owners Policy (BOP)
- Territory: CO
- Revenue: $1.8M
- Years in Business: 7
- Locations: 2

**NAICS & Appetite Assessment**
NAICS 453210 is classified as a preferred risk within our appetite guidelines for BOP coverage. Office supply retailers present standard retail exposures without elevated hazards.

**Eligibility Guidelines Assessment**
According to EligibilityNexus guidelines for BOP coverage:
- Revenue: $1.8M is well within maximum threshold of $5M
- Territory: Colorado is an approved territory for BOP coverage
- Operations: 2 locations is within 5-location maximum for retail eligibility
- Experience: 7 years in business exceeds minimum requirement of 2 years
- Loss History: Total losses of $5,700 over 5 years is well below the concern threshold of $10,000 within a 3-year period

**Conclusion**
Summit Office Solutions meets all eligibility requirements for our standard BOP program: NAICS code within preferred appetite, all operational parameters within guidelines, loss history well within acceptable thresholds, and territory approved for coverage. This submission qualifies for standard BOP with no concerning characteristics.
