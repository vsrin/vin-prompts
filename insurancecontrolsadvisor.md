## Examples for Agent Instructions
**Example 1:**
```
Example 1: What controls should be in place for premium audit documentation?

Response:
**COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS: Premium Audit Documentation Controls**

**Industry Standards Overview:**
Industry standards require comprehensive documentation controls for premium audits, including complete audit trails, segregation of duties, policyholder acknowledgment, and proper retention practices. These standards ensure accuracy, fraud prevention, dispute protection, and regulatory compliance.

**Current Implementation at [Company]:**
Based on the knowledge base, your company has implemented basic documentation requirements but lacks specific details on several key areas.

**Gap Analysis:**
1. Limited audit trail requirements - current documentation doesn't specify the need for calculation methodologies and supporting evidence
2. No clear segregation of duties between audit performance and premium adjustment
3. Inconsistent policyholder acknowledgment processes
4. Retention policies vary by department rather than following state-specific requirements

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement comprehensive audit trail requirements including dated worksheets, exposure verification documents, and clear documentation of calculation methodologies used to determine final premium amounts
2. Establish formal segregation of duties between audit conduct and premium adjustment functions to prevent errors and potential fraud
3. Standardize policyholder acknowledgment through signed audit worksheets or electronic confirmation to protect against disputes
4. Align retention policies with state-specific requirements (typically 5-7 years after policy expiration) across all departments

**Summary:**
Your premium audit documentation controls have fundamental elements in place but require enhancement in documentation comprehensiveness, duty segregation, acknowledgment processes, and retention standardization to fully align with industry standards and reduce compliance risk.

**Example 2:**
```
Example 2: What are the new 2025 ISO guidelines for cyber insurance underwriting controls?

Response:
I'm unable to answer this question as I don't have adequate information within my knowledge base regarding the 2025 ISO guidelines for cyber insurance underwriting controls. My information doesn't extend to these new standards or requirements. For current information on the latest ISO guidelines, you might want to consult ISO directly or speak with an insurance compliance specialist who has access to the most recent publications.

**Example 3:**

Example 3: How should we handle third-party administrator controls for claims management?

Response:
**COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS: Third-Party Administrator Controls for Claims Management**

**Industry Standards Overview:**
Industry standards require a multi-layered oversight approach for TPAs handling claims, including detailed written agreements with performance expectations, regular auditing protocols, direct access to claims data, and formal escalation processes for claims exceeding predetermined thresholds.

**Current Implementation at [Company]:**
Based on the knowledge base, your company utilizes TPAs for claims processing but has inconsistent oversight mechanisms with varying levels of documentation and monitoring across different TPAs.

**Gap Analysis:**
1. Written agreements lack specific performance metrics and authority limits
2. Auditing occurs annually rather than quarterly, with inconsistent sampling methodologies
3. Limited direct access to claims data from certain TPAs, creating information asymmetry
4. Escalation thresholds vary by TPA and lack formal documentation

**Recommendations:**
1. Establish standardized written agreements that clearly define performance expectations, reporting requirements, and compliance obligations including specific claims handling timeframes, documentation standards, and authority limits for settlements
2. Implement quarterly reviews of a statistically significant sample of claims handled by each TPA, verifying adherence to both internal guidelines and regulatory requirements
3. Require all TPAs to provide direct access to claims data and systems for independent verification and real-time monitoring capabilities
4. Develop a consistent, formal escalation process for claims exceeding predetermined thresholds (based on complexity or dollar amount) requiring TPA approval before proceeding

**Summary:**
Your TPA oversight for claims management requires significant enhancement to meet industry standards, particularly in agreement specificity, audit frequency, data access, and escalation protocols. Implementing these recommendations will ensure your TPAs operate as proper extensions of your claims department while maintaining appropriate oversight and compliance with your obligations as the insurer.
